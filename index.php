    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Michaela DeForest. I currently work as a software developer in Malvern, Pennsylvania and am living in Philadelphia. I graduated with a BA in Computer Science in 2017 and am beginning the path of gaining my Master's in Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>While I am taking this class to fulfill a requirement, I chose it in hopes that it helps me in my job. I have had to learn a lot about web application development on my own while building a few Ruby on Rails apps for work. I am interested in gaining some formal web application development skills.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing violin, playing basketball, and attending hackathons.</p>
